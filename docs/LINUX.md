# Linux support

**Short answer: not yet.** Alfred-OS's scheduling layer is `launchd`, which is macOS-only. The framework code itself (`agent_runner.py`, the helper scripts) is Python and Bash and runs fine on Linux — but without a scheduling layer that mirrors `launchd`'s per-user agent semantics, the fleet isn't actually a fleet.

## Why launchd specifically

The framework's per-firing isolation depends on a few `launchd` properties:

- **Per-user agents**, not system services. Operator can edit/reload plists without sudo.
- **`KeepAlive`-free fire-and-forget**. `StartInterval` / `StartCalendarInterval` triggers a one-shot run; the process exits and `launchd` is happy. No process-supervisor accidentally restarting a crashing agent in a tight loop.
- **`bootstrap` / `bootout` semantics** — paused agents stay paused across operator login/logout cycles via the marker file at `$HERMES_HOME/state/_paused/<agent>`.
- **stdout / stderr to per-agent files** at `/tmp/<label>.{stdout,stderr}` — the operator's grep-and-tail muscle memory.
- **`EnvironmentVariables` block** in the plist — a clean per-agent env without polluting the operator's shell.

systemd user units cover most of this (`Type=oneshot`, `OnCalendar=`, no `Restart=on-failure`), but the operational surface is different enough that supporting both well requires a real port, not a translation layer.

## What works on Linux today

If you want to read the code, write your own agents, run the test suite, or use the `agent_runner` primitives in a manually-driven script, **all of that works on Linux**. Specifically:

- `lib/agent_runner.py` — every primitive (preflight, lock, spend, claude_invoke, gh, slack, claim_issue/release_issue, severity routing) works unchanged.
- `tests/` — `pytest` runs the full 35-case suite on Linux.
- `bin/doctor.sh` — works (it's just bash + grep).
- `bin/hermes-claude` — works (just symlink swapping).
- `examples/bin/label_state.py` — works.
- `examples/git-hooks/pre-push` — works (operator-side, runs in your shell).

**What doesn't work**:

- `launchd/render.sh` — generates `.plist` files. Linux doesn't have plists.
- `deploy.sh` — calls `launchctl bootstrap`. Will fail with command-not-found.
- The `install.sh` macOS check — refuses to run unless you set `ALFRED_FORCE_LINUX=1`.

## How to run alfred-os-shaped agents on Linux today

Until the systemd port lands, you have two options:

### Option 1: cron + a wrapper script

Skip the framework's launchd bits entirely. Write each agent as you'd write a bash script:

```cron
# crontab -e
*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/env HERMES_HOME=$HOME/.hermes WORKSPACE_ROOT=$HOME/code GH_ORG=myorg python3 $HOME/code/myfleet/bin/lucius.py >> /tmp/lucius.log 2>&1
```

You lose the per-agent stdout/stderr separation and the `_paused/` marker pattern, but the framework primitives all work. Shape your `bin/<codename>.py` exactly as the macOS examples show.

### Option 2: systemd user units (manually written)

Drop a unit + timer per agent in `~/.config/systemd/user/`:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/alfred-os-lucius.service
[Unit]
Description=alfred-os Lucius (feature-dev agent)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
EnvironmentFile=%h/.alfredrc
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env python3 %h/.hermes/bin/lucius.py
StandardOutput=append:%h/.hermes/logs/lucius.stdout
StandardError=append:%h/.hermes/logs/lucius.stderr
```

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/alfred-os-lucius.timer
[Unit]
Description=alfred-os Lucius timer

[Timer]
OnUnitActiveSec=20min
Unit=alfred-os-lucius.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Enable + start:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now alfred-os-lucius.timer
```

Pause:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now alfred-os-lucius.timer
```

Status:

```sh
systemctl --user list-timers
journalctl --user -u alfred-os-lucius -n 50
```

This is what a `systemd/render.sh` would generate. Until that ships, you're hand-rolling.

## Roadmap for first-class Linux support

Not committed to a date, but the structure of the work is clear:

1. **`systemd/_template.service` + `systemd/_template.timer`** — analogous to `launchd/_template.plist`.
2. **`systemd/render.sh`** — same TSV input as `launchd/agents.conf`, different output format.
3. **`deploy.sh` host detection** — branch on `uname -s` and call the right renderer.
4. **`bin/alfred-style` wrapper** — shell helper that wraps `systemctl --user` calls in operator-friendly commands (`alfred pause` etc.).
5. **`install.sh` Linux branch** — apt/dnf/pacman package install paths instead of brew.
6. **Test the round-trip** on at least Ubuntu LTS and Fedora.

If you want to do this work, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — we'll happily review a PR. If you want to *fund* the work, file an issue with your willingness to sponsor and we'll scope it together.

## What about WSL2?

WSL2 on Windows is a Linux kernel — the same constraints apply. Cron works, systemd-user works (in distros that enable it). We don't actively test WSL2 but no part of the framework should care that it's running there.

The bigger gotcha on WSL2 is path mapping: `WORKSPACE_ROOT` should be a `~/code` style Linux path, not `/mnt/c/Users/...`. Cross-filesystem worktrees are slow and Windows file-locking semantics confuse `git worktree`.

## What about Docker?

Alfred-OS is not container-friendly today. The launchd/systemd assumption means you'd need to host the scheduler outside the container and shell into it for each firing — at which point you've reimplemented `launchctl kickstart` poorly. A "alfred-os in a container" pattern would need the framework to expose its own minimal scheduler and abandon the host-scheduler dependency. Not on the roadmap.

If you want to run agents *inside* containers (e.g. a per-firing Docker image with isolated tooling), that's compatible — write your codename's `bin/<name>.py` to `docker run --rm ... claude -p ...` instead of calling `claude` directly. The framework doesn't care what shell you wrap around the LLM call.
